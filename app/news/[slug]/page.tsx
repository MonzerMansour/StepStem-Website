                StepSTEM not only teaches students about the nature of oil spills and the STEM prospects available, but
                also emphasizes that this environmental problem remains relevant in the present day. Following the
                incident, we incorporated it into our 2024 revised curriculum, accessible under the Our Service section
                of the website. We tailor our explanation to suit the students' comprehension level, while also
                upholding our commitment to raising awareness. As part of this mission, we have written a detailed
                article covering the 2024 Singapore oil spill, including its cause, clean-up efforts, and impact.
              </p>

              <p>
                On June 14, 2024, a significant maritime incident took place near the Pasir Panjang Terminal in
                Singapore, involving two vessels: the Netherlands-flagged dredger Vox Maxima and the stationary
                Singapore-flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour. The collision occurred at 2:18 pm, resulting in a
                devastating allision that led to the spillage of approximately 400 tonnes of low-sulfur fuel oil into
                the waters surrounding the area.
              </p>

              <p>
                The collision led to immediate emergency response actions by local authorities and environmental
                agencies to manage and reduce the environmental impact of the oil spill. The marine ecosystem, including
                marine life and coastal habitats, faced a significant threat from the spilled fuel oil. The Maritime and
                Port Authority (MPA) notified the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) about the spill around 3:30 pm.
                Subsequently, the SDC cordoned off the affected areas that same night and initiated cleanup operations
                the following day, deploying workers to address the contamination on the beaches and surrounding waters
                of Sentosa Island. Multiple organizations deployed approximately 18 response vessels to contain and
                clean up the spill, utilizing floating pipes called booms to prevent further leakage around the Marine
                Honour. On June 16, the SDC dispatched an additional 100 trained personnel equipped with specialized
                tools including oil booms, vacuum pumps, oil dispersants, skimmers, absorbent materials, and more.

                Following the oil spill, the Labrador Nature Reserve was shut down on June 15th. The next day, access to
                the beaches of St. John's Island, Lazarus Island, and Kusu Island was restricted to visitors due to the
                presence of oil slick and sheen in the surrounding waters. In order to safeguard the fish farms along
                the Johor Straits, the Singapore Food Agency initiated precautionary monitoring measures. Marine
                Stewards, a conservation group in Singapore, reported the rescue of an oil-covered kingfisher at Keppel
                Bay and the sighting of another oil-covered kingfisher at Lazarus Island. Furthermore, numerous
                instances of dead fish, sea snakes, lizards, and otters coated in oil were observed. Fortunately, the
                oil spill did not impact Singapore's water supply, as stated by the Public Utlities Board (PUB) on June
                17.

                By June 20, the majority of the oil had been cleaned from the impacted beaches. Grace Fu, the Minister
                for Sustainability and the Environment, announced that more than 71,000 kg of oil-soaked sand had been
                cleared from three beaches on Sentosa Island. Despite the slow progress in the cleanup efforts, this
                oil-related catastrophe not only harmed the wildlife, beaches, and residents of Sentosa Island but also
                had repercussions on neighboring countries. The government of Johor, Malaysia, confirmed that it had
                commenced monitoring the surrounding waters upon receiving notification from the MPA regarding the oil
                spill in Singapore. The Johor Department of Environment (DoE) sought assistance from various agencies to
                conduct patrols and monitor the water, as reported by Liang Tian Soon, the chairperson of the Johor
                Health and Environment Committee. Traces of oil slicks were observed off the Johor coast and on the
                shores of Sunjai Rengit, Teluk Ramunia, and Pengerang, prompting the initiation of cleanup operations on
                June 21. Moreover, Malaysian news sources estimated that approximately 200 fishermen had been unable to
                fish at sea due to the oil slicks since June 16.

                The incident involving the Marine Honour has sparked a significant discussion surrounding maritime
                safety protocols and vessel navigation procedures. It has underscored the crucial importance of
                effective communication between ships to avert potential accidents in the future. The aftermath of the
                oil spill not only led to environmental concerns but also triggered a series of compensatory actions
                from the owners of the vessel towards various governmental bodies, including Singapore government
                agencies and neighboring countries' authorities. This unfortunate event has highlighted the intricate
                web of challenges faced in the maritime industry, emphasizing the need for rigorous safety measures to
                mitigate risks associated with maritime transportation. The incident has served as a poignant reminder
                of the potential consequences of lapses in safety protocols and the devastating impact they can have on
                the environment and local communities. Moving forward, it is imperative for all stakeholders in the
                maritime sector to prioritize safety, communication, and proactive measures to prevent similar disasters
                from happening again.
